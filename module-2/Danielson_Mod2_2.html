		<h1>All About Andrew Danielson</h1>
		<h2>Chapter One - The Basics'</h2>

	<p class="intro">Paragraph 1. This is an introduction about me. I grew up in a the capital of the state of Idaho, Boise. I have always been interested in technology. When I was young, I would tear down various electronics just to see how they were put together. In my free time, I enjoy playing video games and spending time with my family.</p>

	<p>Paragraph 2. This is another paragraph about me. I joined the United States Air Force right out of high school. It was not until I separated from Active Duty in 2010 that I returned to school. I graduated from college with a AAS degree in electronics technology, but the Air Force was calling me once again. I am always looking for ways to improve my skills and learn new technologies.</p>

	<p>Paragraph 3. This is a third paragraph about me. <span class="sentence">I am married to my high school sweetheart and we are blessed with five children and we enjoy traveling and exploring new places.</span> Currently the USAF has taken us to Germany. I also enjoy reading books and watching movies and historical dramas in my spare time.</p>

	<p>Paragraph 4. This is a fourth paragraph about me. I am excited to be taking this course and look forward to learning more about HTML and CSS. I hope to use these skills in the future after retirement to gain employment as a developer and create better user experiences.</p>
